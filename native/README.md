# LockPort client mod 1.2.1

Optional companion for LockPort 3.7.5. The addon works without it for manual summons.

## Install with VanillaFixes

1. Close WoW.
2. Back up the existing addon folder and dlls.txt.
3. Copy the repository's LockPort folder into Interface/AddOns.
4. Copy LockPort.dll from the repository root beside VanillaFixes.exe.
5. Add one line containing LockPort.dll at the end of dlls.txt, after other client mods.
6. Launch through VanillaFixes. Join a party or raid on a warlock and enable Auto Summon.

Updating from addon 3.7.2, 3.7.3, or 3.7.4 needs only the addon folder and /reload.
Earlier DLL versions must be replaced, followed by a full client restart.
/lockport debug should report native=1.2.1.

## Compatibility and behavior

Built for the inspected 32-bit OctoWoW 1.18.1 WoW.exe and WoW_Modernized.exe
function signatures. This is not a universal build for all client versions.
It refuses unsupported executables and requires Lua-registration compatibility
provided by Nampower, SuperWoW, or ClassicAPI. Load LockPort after those mods.

The DLL resolves a canonical raid1..raid40 or party1..party4 unit to its GUID,
finds Ritual of Summoning in the spellbook, and invokes the client spellbook
function. It temporarily saves and clears the frame-script execution context
and depth around that call, then restores both. This follows the command context
pattern documented in [ClassicAPI 1.17.1](https://github.com/brues-code/ClassicAPI/blob/v1.17.1/src/Offsets.h).
It limits calls to the Lua thread and rate-limits requests. A successful return
means the call was submitted, not that a server summon or arrival succeeded.

The addon still requires helpers and target eligibility. Helpers click the
portal and the summoned player accepts. Auto Summon and availability
announcements reset on login/reload; leaving the group disables Auto Summon.

The user confirmed successful automatic summoning with 1.2.1 in-game.
Regression tests use mocked game APIs and do not cover every client/mod setup.

To uninstall, close WoW and remove LockPort.dll from dlls.txt. Do not hot-unload.

## Build and tests

Source: LockPort.c. Build from the repository root with an LLVM-MinGW i686 compiler:

    powershell -File native/build.ps1 -Compiler i686-w64-mingw32-clang.exe

Python addon tests require lupa with its lua51 module:

    python -m pip install lupa
    python tests/test_addon.py

Build the native harness as an x86 executable at image base 0x10000000 with ASLR disabled:

    i686-w64-mingw32-clang -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -static-libgcc -Wl,--image-base,0x10000000 -Wl,--disable-dynamicbase tests/native_tests.c -o native_tests.exe
    native_tests.exe "path/to/WoW.exe" LockPort.dll

The first argument defaults to WoW.exe; the second defaults to LockPort.dll.
Run from the repository root. Tests check unsupported-host rejection, client
signatures, hook relocation/chaining, thread/unit/rate checks, GUID and spellbook
forwarding, and scoped context restoration. No server connection is made.

The binary uses Windows system libraries (UCRT and Kernel32).
SHA256SUMS.txt records its checksum. See CLASSICAPI-REVIEW.md for the API review.
